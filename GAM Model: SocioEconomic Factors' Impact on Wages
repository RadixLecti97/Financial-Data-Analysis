Understanding the variables:

First, combine the categorical variables education, race, and health, then determine whether the age variable would be better as a polynomial or linear regression. 
```{r}
fit1=lm(wage~education+race+health,data=Wage)
fit2=lm(wage~education+race+health+age,data=Wage)
fit3=lm(wage~education+race+health+poly(age,2),data=Wage)
fit4=lm(wage~education+race+health+poly(age,3),data=Wage)
anova(fit1,fit2,fit3,fit4)
```

Fitting the GAM Model:

Next, a basic GAM model is built, used to answer the research question:
“What socioeconomic factors have a significant impact on health?”
```{r}
gam<-gam(wage~education+race+health+age+year+jobclass,data=Wage)
```
The basic model's summary output shows that there is significance given their low p-values among all the socioeconomic factors in their effects on wages 
```{r}
summary(gam)
```
However, given their polynomial regressions, year and age require smoothing splines, which are used to prevent large tail movement behavior in the case of polynomial regression. So, we calculate the ideal degrees of freedom and fit them to the model.
```{r}
smooth.year = smooth.spline(x=year, y=logwage, cv=FALSE)
cat("Optimal Degrees of Freedom of the smoothing spline for 'year': ", smooth.year$df,"\n")
smooth.age = smooth.spline(x=age, y=logwage, cv=FALSE)
cat("Optimal Degrees of Freedom of the smoothing spline for 'age': ", smooth.age$df)
```
```{r}
gam1 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567), data=Wage)
gam2 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804), data=Wage)
gam3 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education, data=Wage)
gam4 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education + health_ins, data=Wage)
gam5 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education + health_ins +
maritl, data=Wage)
gam6 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education + health_ins +
maritl + health, data=Wage)
gam7 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education + health_ins +
maritl + health + jobclass, data=Wage)
gam8 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education + health_ins +
maritl + health + jobclass + race , data=Wage)
anova(gam1, gam2, gam3, gam4, gam5, gam6, gam7, gam8, test="F")
```

Conclusion:

As seen from the ANOVA, all the factors are good predictors of logwage except for jobclass and race, which were added on to models 7 and 8, greatly increasing the p-values from 10^-16 to 10^-2, close to the alpha levels of 0.05. This is particularly intriguing given the widespread news and social expectations that race and job class have a large effect on wage. 


Checking for Issues:

Plotting the residuals vs the fitted values allows us to ensure that the residuals are randomly distributed, and as seen here, there is a healthy distribution of data around the residuals=0 axis, meaning constant variance is for the most part present, except for wage earners earning over $220,000 highlighted in teal.

```{r}
gam7 = gam(logwage ~ s(age, df=7.567) + s(year, df=2.804) + education + health_ins +
maritl + health + jobclass, data=Wage)
ggplot() +
geom_point(aes(x=gam7$fitted.values, y=gam7$residuals, color=as.factor(I(wage>220)))) +
labs(x="Fitted values", y="Residuals", color="wage > 220")
